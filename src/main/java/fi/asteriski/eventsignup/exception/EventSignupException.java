This class exist only to make test writing easier.
All subclasses originally extended RuntimeException.
However, checking whether a method throws a RuntimeException in tests is not particularly useful since many other components can throw that too.
Thus having a custom super class for expected exceptions makes it easier to check that the exception originated in the component being tested.
